  **Functional Test:**

  Shopping Cart Checkout Feature:

- When a user tries to check out:
- Ask if the user wants to log in, checkout as guest, or create an account.
- If the cart is empty display an empty cart message and prompt to add items.
- Show the total cost of the items in the cart.

- When a user tries to check out as a logged-in user:

  - If the cart is empty, display an empty cart message and prompt customer to add items.
  - Show the total cost and or discounts of the items in the cart.
  - Display the user's shipping and billing information.
  - Confirm the delivery/billing address information is correct.
  - Prompt user to provide accepted payment forms.
  - Confirm the order and provide a confirmation number.

    **Edge Cases and Additional Scenarios:**

- When a user adds items to the cart, update the cart count and total cost in real-time.
- If the user logs in after adding items as a guest, the items in the cart should be transferred to the user's account.
- If the user logs in, but their cart has items from a previous session, ask if they want to merge the carts or start a new one.
- If the user cancels the checkout process, return them to the cart page with the items still in the cart.
- If the user proceeds with the checkout process and completes the purchase, show a confirmation page with the order details and a thank you message.
